While the title 'Professor' suggests a senior academic position, it does not explicitly indicate a principal researcher role. However, his extensive publication record and citations suggest a strong research focus. He has published numerous articles in reputable journals, including topics related to biosensors and nanotechnology, indicating significant contributions to his field (Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g7STlDMAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Despite not holding a title like 'Principal Researcher' or 'Chief Scientist', the evidence of leading research projects and having a substantial citation index (5926 citations, h-index of 41) implies that he operates at a high level of research autonomy and responsibility. Therefore, while he may not fit the exact title criteria, his role as a Professor with a strong research output aligns closely with the expectations of a principal researcher.
