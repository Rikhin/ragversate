Search results indicate that professors at the University of Michigan are expected to hold high standards of research and scholarship (facultyhandbook.provost.umich.edu/6-k-professional-responsibilities). While the title itself isn't explicitly listed in the criterion's examples (Principal Researcher, Research Director, etc.), the responsibilities associated with a professorship, including research and scholarship, align with the general description of senior-level research responsibility. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider a professorship at the University of Michigan as equivalent to a senior research position, especially since the criterion mentions considering positions where the description indicates leadership or oversight of research projects or teams, or responsibility for the integrity, direction, or management of research.
